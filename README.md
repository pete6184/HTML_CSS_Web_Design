# Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Requirements & Summary
For this assignment we used a code editor (I used Visual Studio Code) to write our code, launched the website through the code editors' live server, and then 'hosted' the web page via github-pages.

This was my introduction to HTML and CSS and I enjoyed playing around with styling webpages. There was some struggles with getting the CSS to work properly in the beginning and finding out the hierarchy of the styling attributes but I was able to figure it out and overcome the challenges I was having. Overall, I really enjoyed this challenge and look forward to see what else I can do with making web pages.

## Background

Data is more powerful when we share it with others! Let's take what we've learned about HTML and CSS to create a website showing off the analysis we've done.

For this homework we created a visualization dashboard website using the visualizations we created in a past assignment. Specifically, we plotted from the API WeatherPy assignment.

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which individuals can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations.

### Website Requirements

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
